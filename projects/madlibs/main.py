Once upon a time there was a person named: {input("Proper Noun: ")}. 
{input("Proper Noun: ")} always has a {input("Noun: ")} on them. 
They work at {input("Noun: ")} and like to visit {input("Noun: ")} on their vacation days.
Their favorite food is a {input("Adjective: ")} {input("Noun: ")}.
{input("Proper Noun: ")} also has a {input("Adjective: ")} robotic arm.
With their robotic arm they can {input("Noun (2 words): ")} and {input("Phrase: ")}
There are many activities that they enjoy.
{input("Proper Noun: ")} always does these activities with them.
